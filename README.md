# Olympics-Data-Analysis
- The project involves a comprehensive analysis of the Olympic Games data , focusing on event and athlete data. The analysis combines multiple datasets, handles errors in the data, and presents detailed insights into medal tallies, athlete performance, and country-wise achievements.

###  Data Preparation and Cleaning : 
- Combining Event and Athlete Files : The analysis begins by merging the athlete and event datasets to form a comprehensive dataset that contains detailed information about each athleteâ€™s participation in events and the medals they won.
- Handling Errors : The data is carefully cleaned, addressing missing values, correcting inconsistencies (e.g., mismatched event names), and removing any duplicate records to ensure the quality of the data for analysis.

###  Medal Tally and Overall Analysis : 
- Medal Tally : The total number of medals (Gold, Silver, and Bronze) won by each country is calculated and visualized. This analysis helps in understanding the performance of different countries in various Olympic editions.
- Overall Analysis : Several overall statistics are generated to provide a snapshot of the entire dataset:
  - Number of Editions : The total number of Olympic editions covered in the data.
  - Number of Cities : The total number of cities that hosted the Olympics.
  - Number of Events/Games : A count of the unique events or games held in each Olympic edition.
  - Number of Athletes : The total number of athletes who participated in the Olympics across all editions.
  - Number of Participating Nations : The number of different countries that participated in the Olympic Games.

###  Country-Wise Analysis : 
- Country Wise Medal Tally per Year (Line Plot) : A line plot is created to show the number of medals won by each country in different years, helping to visualize trends in the performance of countries over time.
- Which Countries Are Good (Heatmap) :  A heatmap is generated to show which countries consistently perform well across multiple Olympic editions, providing a visual representation of countries' medal counts by year.
- Most Successful Athletes (Top 10 Country-Wise): The top 10 athletes from each country are identified based on their medal achievements, showing the most successful athletes in the history of the Olympics per country.


The Olympic data analysis provides valuable insights into the history and trends of the Olympic Games. From tracking the success of countries and athletes to visualizing medal tallies over the years
